title:  "Thanks to the Wonderful People at Progressive Insurance"

This summer I've had the great experience of working as a software engineering intern for Progressive Insurance, working on a team building a quoting application for small business insurance. I got to work with the latest technologies and was given the freedom to exercise my problem-solving skills to improve the team's application - in an internship, what more can you ask for? Progressive likes to tout their company culture, and having spent a summer with them, their bragging is clearly earned. This is a company that cares about its employees, their personal development, and their work-life balance.

The video shared <a href="https://lnkd.in/ebnQQik">here</a> is from a promotion campaign centered around National Intern Day, in which a few interns were selected to talk about their experiences. I was specifically asked to discuss how my experience at Progressive is shaping my future.

And now, a few well-deserved thank-you's:
Thanks to my manager, Deron Sohngen, my associate PM Travis Huth, my mentor Jim Alexander, my resource manager Jacob Koehler, the IT Internship program leads Jane Shaw and Eugene Kenyo, and the IT college recruiting team, especially Aimee Carcioppolo and Lindsey Hojnowski, for coming together to make my experience all that it was!
